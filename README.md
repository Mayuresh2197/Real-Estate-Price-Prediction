# Real-Estate-Price-Prediction

To predict the prices of houses with Regression 

Introduction: I have chosen to do this project, as the main idea behind this is Machine Learning, in which I have previously done a project and would like to expand my knowledge in that field. This project deals with how to accurately predict prices for houses that are given in the dataset. This dataset is taken from Kaggle. I have done the coding in Python using Jupyter Notebook, by using the Regression Analysis as the main technique.

Abstract: Real Estate is one of the most rapidly booming industries today, considering the population growth and the decreasing availability of spacious land to live in. At such a time, it becomes difficult to calculate the selling price of the property. This is because it is not an easy job to evaluate the individual price of the various features that come along with the property and come to a cumulative price that is affordable or reasonable. 
Many a times, the houses are sold for a price that is much higher than they are worth. This is the reason that I have decided to do this project based on Kaggle’s Housing Dataset, which contains the Train and Test Dataset.
The Train dataset contains about 81 different features like Lot Area, Sale Condition, Overall Quality, Pool Area, Neighborhood, Street, Sale Price etc. and these 81 features have 1460 readings. 
The Test dataset has the same features, except the Sale Price. This is because the project deals with predicting the Sale Price and thus the machine calculates the prices for the Test dataset.

Coding: Before starting with the code, I shall list out the ways in which I have bifurcated the code. The main parts of this project are:
Acquire the data

Explore the data

Engineer and transform the features and the target variable

Build a model

Evaluation and Visualization 

Make and submit predictions

CODE: The Jupyter Notebook for the same has been attached to this repository. 

CONCLUSION: By doing this project, I can easily predict the prices of all the properties given in the Test Dataset. This can be applied for bigger datasets as well.
A proper and an unbiased prediction of property prices is utmost necessary for today’s world as the Real Estate Industry is one of the biggest industries. This can not only prove useful for Real Estate but for other industries as well. For example, industries can use Machine Learning to predict how much costs they would incur, if the other factors related to it are present in a dataset. Companies can predict how high their customer network shall grow for a product. 
In short, Machine Learning has tremendous beneficial applications in today’s world. If used in the right way, many tasks can be simplified and can reduce human efforts, which can be put to use elsewhere.
